1. EndpointCollection cache time is 20 seconds - expected much longer

2. in the schema of schema application/vnd.ccp.eve.Options-v1+json - 
   representation 1.  I did not see this "contentType" field in the returned data
   
	name: contentType
	description: null
	optional: true
	extraData: null
	typePrettyName: Dictionary
	type: Dict
	
3. see the options.txt dump, search "look here" and find the "corporations"
   only the schema representation is returned not the value representation.
    
4. see the options.txt dump, 3rd look here or so.  DecodeToken's two 
representations are swapped compared to all others I've seen.

5. route /virtualGoodStore/ reported by EndpointCollection fails the request with
href: https://vgs-tq.eveonline.com/ HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed

6. If an endpoints "acceptType->name:" ("Access") base (string short the version) 
from the schema was included in the EndpointCollection schema an application 
would not have to kludge up a key to be able to map the two together. 

7. /inventory/types/ reported by EndpointCollection is not found in the schema reported from root

8. naming on decode/TokenDecode is inconsistent in Options verses EndpointCollection - very minor

9. all endpoints should be in a group.  As reported by EndpointCollection the following violate this:
/alliances/
/bloodlines/
/constellations/
/corporations/ 
/incursions/
/insuranceprices/
/races/
/regions/
/solarsystems/
/time/
/decode/
/tournaments/
/virtualGoodStore/
/wars/

10. The following are found in current documentation but are not found in the schema or EndpointCollection.  
Note TokenDecode (per crestexplorerjs) is not a solution as it returns values not schema.  A program should
be able determine all the endpoints/schema without being authenticated.

Character
Contacts and Contact
Fittings and Fitting
OpportunitiesRead
Waypoints
Location
Open Window
Planets and Planet
Stargate
War  (WarCollection is there but seems incomplete, war is missing)

11. the following are missing from the documentation
corporations
npcCorporations
industryFacilities
industrySystems
tokenDecode
virtualGoodStore

12. AllianceCollection first json entry is 'totalCount_str="2988"' totalCount_str 
is not mentioned in the schema, it comes first.  Why would we have any "_str" on 
long values anyway? schema indicates "pageCount" should be the first element and 
be of type long.  The declared 3rd element, id Long is missing.
12.a Alliance id_str not declared in schema its declared as id Long.  Once again
out of order.
12.b pageCount_str not in schema

13. I'm going to assume all the rest are similar to 12 and quit logging them.

14. avoid wrapping simple href's in their own objects.
