                <h1>Authentication</h1>
            </h3>
            <p>
                This is a development box and so will be up/down and
                will not be a permanent situation, but if anyone wants
                to see the eve SOS in action feel free.<br> <br>http://ec2-23-20-106-130.compute-1.amazonaws.com<br>http://23.20.106.130<br>
                <br>The authentication is a dual purpose situation.
                First it distinguishes what pages in the application a
                user has rights to while they are interacting with the
                application. Currently the AccessGroup db table provides
                these groups:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anonymous</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directors</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extensible for custom</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There is also a Rights table which currently only has
                the following right<br> <br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SharedRight</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Directors will be able to create other custom groups and
                assign capsuleer's to those groups. Capsuleer's will be
                able to assign ShareRights to other capsuleers or groups
                that allow those individuals access to their personal
                (User group) information.<br> <br>This
                trickles over to actual access rights to the public API
                side of the SPI Cache, verses character and corporation
                private. Everyone is a member of the Anonymous group
                (public data). An authenticated capsuleer is in the User
                group (character/corp). Currently at least one Director
                has to be configured at installation/startup to provide
                an individual with "Admin" rights to go from there.<br>
                <br>I currently have a single properties file
                (simple name/value pairs) for configuration. When I
                started I only had a single app per installation in
                mind. For example, the applications required scopes are
                declared here. The Director/s are also declared here. As
                the cache evolved in my design, and my discovery that
                RabbitMQ has implementations for all of the languages
                our group use is available, I realized a big buy here is
                for multiple applications to share the cost of the
                server. Thus I will look at how to break up these
                groups/rights, and capsuleers/directors partitioned by
                application, and make these accessible to the app for
                their own restriction purposes.<br> <br>So,
                future, not only will this be able to provide
                SSO/access_token and fresh async data pushed to the
                application but a ACL system for the application to
                leverage and for individual capsuleers to share with
                others (alts will love it)<br> <br>Do note if
                you authenticate the system at this time, it will
                capture your refresh_token in the db and can/currently
                will continue to refresh any endpoints that are accessed
                by a given CharacterID. You can go to the following url
                to invalidate this refresh_token ... but the db is super
                volatile and will continue to undergo change anyway
                (regularly blown away).<br>

                1. https://eclipse.org/downloads/ run the download, its
                an installer, pick "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers"<br>2.
                https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi<br>3.
                https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi (don't get v8
                or 9 if you want to play with the PHPBridge)<br>4.
                https://www.postgresql.org/ postgresSql<br> <br>for
                the tomcat, unzip it anywhere ... I happen to gather
                this sort of stuff at c:\tools\* but it does not matter.
                Also, you will only need this if you plan to
                run/single-step debug. You will only need the maven if
                you want to build/run it.<br> <br>These
                instructions will get you into the source quickly as any
                IDE has it's painful learning curve.<br>I like
                short paths, all at the bottom. Do something similar. If
                you follow this pattern it will make eclipse life better
                long term. ws stands for WorkSpace in eclipse.<br>
                <br>First create something similar to the following
                directory structure<br>c:\ws<br>c:\ws\eclipse<br>c:\ws\ccc-common<br>c:\ws\crestj<br>
                <br>git tools don't like cloning into folders that
                have anything in them. Copy the two that you cloned into
                their corresponding ccc-common and crestj folders in the
                above structure and delete them from where you
                originally cloned them out to.<br> <br>When
                you first fire up eclipse it's going to ask you for a
                "Workspace" folder, set it to c:\ws\eclipse<br> <br>In
                eclipse, hook it up with your git clone as follows<br>File-&gt;new-&gt;project...
                pick "Java Project"<br>Right under Project Name
                there is a "Use default location" check box, de-select
                it and browse to your git clone locations.<br> <br>There
                are the two git repositories, each with multiple
                "modules" or "projects" or "jars" these are synonymous
                terms. So with the above mentioned browse to, select say
                ccc-db. Repeat this process for all of the projects in
                the two repositories.<br> <br>c:\wsc\ccc-common
                (has .git repo)<br>c:\wsc\ccc-common\ccc-db (a jar
                - select me)<br>c:\wsc\ccc-common\ccc-oauth (a jar
                - select me)<br>c:\wsc\ccc-common\ccc-tools (a jar
                - select me)<br>c:\wsc\ccc-common\ccc-wicket (a jar
                - select me)<br> <br>I need to get scratch.jar
                out of there at some point, its for junk playing around
                right now.<br> <br>c:\wsc\crestj (has .git
                repo)<br>c:\wsc\crestj\crest-core (a jar select me)<br>c:\wsc\crestj\crest-da
                (a jar select me)<br>c:\wsc\crestj\crest-pd-da (a
                jar select me)<br>c:\wsc\crestj\crest-web (a .war
                (special jar) select me)<br>c:\wsc\crestj\crest-wicket
                (a jar select me)<br>c:\wsc\crestj\nee-d (a jar
                select me - skeletal application that sparked this slow,
                overly designed nightmare)<br> <br>longer term
                in the "Project Explorer" tab the cryptic small graphics
                at the top, check out the triangle and "working sets" to
                better organize these two sets.<br> <br>At
                this point you should have 12 eclipse projects which are
                typed java and may or may not have realized they are
                also of type maven (they have a pom.xml in them). Look
                close at the folder icons for each of the 12, there
                should be an 'm' upper left corner and 'j' upper right
                corner. Select any/all that don't have the 'm', right
                click and select "configure-&gt;maven<br> <br>Everything
                is going to be red at this point (not building), but you
                will have full IDE helps ... F3 any selected item jumps
                you to the declaration of that item, etc. watch for the
                various navigational mnemonics and accelerators in the
                right click pull downs.<br> <br>Ok, if you
                want to build and get rid of all the red. I use
                ccc-common for a lot of other personal/work stuff, thus
                I've used an advanced feature of maven for dependency
                version management that utilizes parent poms. You need
                to get these parents loaded into your local .m2
                repository. To do this execute the batch file at:<br>
                <br>c:\ws\ccc-common\shadowbuild\parents\buildParents.bat
                install<br> <br>it will need that install
                command line parameter.<br> <br>Ok, at this
                point you have two build systems, the maven command line
                build, which is used for final deployments, this is the
                master. Then you have Eclipses auto maven build, a
                subset of the command line which does it's own caching
                of the .m2 repository classes/jars for IDE time
                dependencies etc. Sometimes these two get out of synch,
                and we have definitely confused eclipse at this time.<br>
                <br>To fix this, right click on any of the projects
                (i.e. crest-core) select "maven-&gt;update project ..."
                and hit the "Select All" button and then ok.<br> <br>All
                the red will drop.<br> <br>if it does not
                drop, I have a cart-before the horse situation in the
                build poms that I'm not sure resolve in a clean
                environment. Holler if that's the case.<br> <br>later,
                you are real close here to being able to single step
                servlet code running on the tomcat server, so holler
                if/when ready to play with that.aving trouble with
